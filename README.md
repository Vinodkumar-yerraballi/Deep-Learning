Tomato disease prediction using the CNN model


# About the data:

1.   The dataset is taken from the kaggle website and fristly we load the data and add the parameters and such as image shape and rgb etc. And model is compile to the adam optimize this is best optimize to model and check the accuracy score we use the metrics as accuracy.
2.   Once load the data in our model is buliding is beginig with CNN architecture in with the relu activation function and finally we add softmax activation. with 10 epochs our model predict 91% accuracy_score. then we plot the accuracy and loss function using the matplotlibe then finally we predict the our model predict the images good or bad. So we conclude  that our model will be predict good result.then we save the model using the .h5 and hdf5 file and we deployee the model using the streamlit app
